This Hi-C MultiQC report was generated using Hi-C data from [Louise Harewood](mailto:louise.harewood@cruk.cam.ac.uk) at [CRUK Cambridge Institute](http://www.cambridgecancer.org.uk/). Reads were run through [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and then processed using [HiCUP](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/) (Hi-C User Pipeline).

You can download this report and / or the logs used to generate it, to try running MultiQC yourself. Note that the example report has some user-specific config settings, seen in the [multiqc_config.yaml](/examples/hi-c/multiqc_config.yaml) file.
