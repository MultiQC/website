Bismark report for: MethylC-Seq_mm_fc_1wk_SRR921769_1_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.14.4)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /pica/data/uppnex/igenomes/Mus_musculus/Ensembl/GRCm38/Sequence/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --phred33 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	20400069
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	17482188
Mapping efficiency:	85.7%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	717541
Sequences did not map uniquely:	2200340
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	4

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:

CT/GA:	8711692	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
