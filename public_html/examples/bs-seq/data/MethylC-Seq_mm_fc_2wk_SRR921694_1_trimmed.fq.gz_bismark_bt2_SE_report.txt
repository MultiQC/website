Bismark report for: MethylC-Seq_mm_fc_2wk_SRR921694_1_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.14.4)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /pica/data/uppnex/igenomes/Mus_musculus/Ensembl/GRCm38/Sequence/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --phred33 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	153092768
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	120059544
Mapping efficiency:	78.4%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	12078510
Sequences did not map uniquely:	20954714
